To do:
  - [ ] cite this repository in wikipedia against the ARC and NHMRC talk pages: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Australian_Research_Council
  - [ ] https://www.arc.gov.au/about-arc <-- evaluate language
  - [ ] Does H-index represent a form of sanction for academics at the micro-marketplace level? https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07893.pdf
  - [ ] if supervisors (professors) and postgraduate students (PhD candidates) are both invested in ARC funding as a joint marketplace, which actor is reponsible for what and how is value distributed between the two?  Especially in terms of outcome?  Are Supervisors, despite being more highly rewarded, willing to risk less than their PhD candidates? http://ijds.org/Volume10/IJDSv10p039-055Bogelund0714.pdf
