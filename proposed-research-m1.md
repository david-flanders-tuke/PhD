## (I) Title
Proposed high-level titles for final PhD thesis:
  - [ ] Institutional design of collaboration-based research policy for scholarly products
  - [ ] The games researchers play: the value of collaborative scholarly marketplaces and the design of common pool research resources
  - [ ] How do researchers decide the games (and rules) they want to play? - collaboration as means to achieve efficiency for taxpayer funded research policy

### Abstact(s)
Proposed high-level abstracts for final PhD thesis:
 - [ ] Global academic publishing companies have succeeded in large part because of the marketplaces they provide researchers to distribute their research outputs.  In order to identify the aspects of the marketplaces that need improvement (and to avoid undesirable modification), a model for a modern marketplace was needed to guide it's design, definition and deployment.
 - [ ] Common pool resource theory provides investigative behavioural economic field experimetns for determining how best to: share and collaborate as a group of researchers, how collaborative research is communicated, how individual research can evolve their researh outputs independently, and how all the above can be described using both formal (quantitative) and informal (qualitative) notations (metadata).  My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the taxpayer-funded marketplace design of research-based products through experimental constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance and social properties desired of a common-pool marketplace.  A proposed marketplace style is investigated in a series of field experiments designed by Ostrom et al.
 - [ ] This dissertation (via cumulation) defines a marketplace framework for understanding common-pool-resources via behavioural-economic styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the marketplace design of network-based research product outputs.  A survey of marketplace styles (game theory) demonstrates how games can be used to classify marketplace styles according to the behavioural properties induced by groups of researchers collaborating to distribute their research products.  I then introduce a scholarly CPR marketplace 'style' (policies) and describe how behavioural policies can used to guide the design and development of scholarly products as knowledge commons products.
 - [ ] Scholarly CPR marketplaces emphasise meritocracy, digital scalability, generality of use for any discpline, independent deployment by libraries and research councils, contractual obligations, enforced secuity of sanctions and encapsulation of legacy library systems.  I describe the behavioural economic principles behind Scholarly CPRs and the interactions constraints chosen to sustain those collaborative marketplace principles, constrasting them to the constraints of other marketplace styles like those of the $10 billion dollar academic publishing industry.  Finally I describe the lessons learned from applying Scholarly CPR marketplaces to the Academic sector and their adoption, rejection and adjustment of marketplaces deployed on behalf of their research output products.

## (II) Background 
Milestone 1 criteria for PhD research proposal's background context:
  - [x] Literature review of field
  - [x] Situates the research project within the field

### Literature review
  - [ ] Over the past fifty years economics and social science researchers have created new methodologies for evaluating enterprises for public goods, building on traditional economic analysis of entrepreneurship to the private market economy.  Most notable in this endeavor was Elinor Ostrom who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for her "analysis of economic governance, especially the commons", which she shared with Oliver E. Williamson, et al in 2009.  These new research methods provide an opportunity to evaluate Governmental agencies endeavouring to provide public goods.  The focus of this research is the evaluation of 'common property resources' as provided by the Australian taxpayer.
  - [ ] The value of the scholarly marketplace worldwide is now estimated to exceed ten-billion dollars, making it more valuable than the music industry.  The primary resource which derives economic value from this marketplace is the scholarly research publication which is primarily funded by the taxpayer in the USA (National Science Foundation, National Institute of Health, etc), UK (Medical Research Council, Higher Education Funding Council of England), EU (European Commision) and Australasia (Australian Research Council).
  - [ ] The Australian Research Council (ARC) acts as the primary entrepreneur which delegates taxpayer funds as a common property resource to Australian researchers via a research grant marketplace.  Accordingly, for the purpose of this evaluation the research grant marketplace provided by the ARC is defined as a 'public good' because the funds provided are not easy to exclude and are limited. 
  - [ ] The New Instittutional Economic methods for evaluating 'Common Pool Resource' (CPR) marketplaces, like the ARC, are dictated by the mathematical modelling of game theory.  Specifically, the game known as the 'prisoner's dilemma' provides the base combinatorial matrix by which Common Property Resources can be interrogated for their efficiency, or rather lack of efficiency defined as a 'Common Property Resource (CPR) dilemma'.
  - [ ] The catalyst for evaluating group efficiency (or non-cooperative CPR dilemmas) was the field experiments carried out by Ostrom and Cardenas in 1996 in South America.  These field experiments brought together groups of local Colombian farmers to evaluate their group interactions and what, if any, efficiencies and/or dilemmas arose.  Accordingly, the first part of this PhD research is a replication of this field experiment applied to local Australian research groups. 
  - [ ] The hypothetical research questions which arise in these field experiments are two fold: (a) for research groups who are not efficient in their use of taxpayer funding (aka they collectively face a CPR dilemmas), what behaviourval regularities emerge in the development of improved group collaboration theories, and (b) what types of institutional variables (physical, virtual and policy rules) affect the liklihood of successful resolution of CPR dilemmas?
  - [ ] Once this field experiment has been replicated, the findings will fed into the Institutional Advanced Design (IAD) framework, which provides a methodology for bridging CPR theory into practice.  Comparison of the data from the original 1996 field experiment will be compared to the contemporary published results helping further inform the theoreticla foundations of CPR research.  
  - [ ] Pending experimental investigations, the final part of this PhD research could be one of two developments: (i) advancement of the field experiment with additional policy (rules/sanctions) to interrogate research group collaboration efficiencies; and/or (ii) case studies of other research groups in the USA, UK and EU and their participation in the field experiments to inform institutional policy.  Ideally the final thesis will result in evidence to inform the policies of the Australian Research Council and/or University Research Chancellors and their committees.
 
### Potential value of research within the field
Current observable societal issues which this research may inform:
  - [ ] The rise of the 'Open Access' movement has questioned the value which taxpayers receive via government funded research council grants. This research will provide a repeatable experiment whereby small groups of likeminded researchers (5-8 people) can self-evaluate themselves as a group to determine their collaborative efficiency to the taxpayer.
  - [ ] With the rise of databases the ability by governments to track and enforce policy rules has increased significantly, as primarily evidenced by China's surveilance regime under the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Xi Jinping's administration.  These monitorring and sanctioning methods have increased significantly worldwide, especially in Australia via COVID related policy rules and border enforcement.  University administrations are increasingly monitorring and sancitoning researchers in accordance with institutional policy requirements.  How do we know if these policy rules are actually afffective? This research will investigate the value of top down-policy reform and its effecitveness in regulating efficiency of collaborative research groups.
  - [ ] University intensive research institutions in Australia, have been widely percieved as "bad places to work", with labels such as “destructive hyper-competition, toxic power dynamics and poor leadership behaviour”.  The single-minded metric of research excellence has resulted in an Academic culture "that cares exclusively about what is achieved and not about how it is achieved".  Despite numerous reports and claims by Australian Academic leaders (including present and previous 'Group of Eight' Vice-Chancelors) [further funding is being provided to support metrics of excellence](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02951-4).

## (III) [Methodology and Methods](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/methodology.md)
M1 criteria for this section:
  - [x] research methodology
  - [x] appropriateness & scope

### Research methodologies
The theorectical foundations proposed by Ostrom et al for common property resource dilemmas are: (A) empircal well grounded game theory, and (B) bounded rationality theory.  Both of these theories are interrogated via the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework (IAD) which prescribes the following methodologies for the initial field experiment phase of this research.  The the data analysis outputs from this field experiment are two fold:
  - [ ] (a) Quantitative analysis of group decisions to interrogate the optimal efficiency achieved, e.g. are the researchers acting as optimal rational players in the game or are they acting innefficiently, therefore classifying their behaviour as a collective-action dilemma.  Further rounds in the game evaluate the performance of different groups when new rules are added to see if each group performs more or less optimal.
  - [ ] (b) Qualitative analysis of each individual (via post game survey) evaluates the rational behind each decision and classifies these beahviours into framework. The framework organizes the kinds of information that individuals may use in deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a collective-action problem.
  - [ ] (c) Once the quantitative and qualitative data are evaluated, the research will progress the results via the the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework whereby the outcomes will (optimally) result in further case studies to bridge the theoretical results into practice, e.g. proposed policy for research funding councils and/or Universities to utilise policy rules which systematically  increase optimal research group collaboration efficiency.

#### (a) quantitative analysis methods
  - [ ] The formal experimentation methodology which will be used is 'non cooperative game theory' which fundamentally relies on the 'prisoner's dilemma' matrix to evaluate the individual and group decisions during the field experiment.
      - [ ] The first phase of this research reproduces the original field experiment, but with a tradeoff in participant socio-economic status: the orginal participants were rural farmers from Columbia South America, the subjects in this study are University researchers in Australia.  Accordingly, the comparison of these two experimental subjects will juxtapose 'bounded rationality theory', e.g. how will Australian researchers compare to Columbian farmer's in terms of their efficiency and/or dilemmas when attempting to optimise a common property resource?
      - [ ] The post-game interview/survey of participants will evaluate the bounds by which Australian researchers make decisions (as per the framework of the original study) the layered-bounds by which individuals act in groups are hypothesised by Cardenas et al are: (a) personal identity layer, (b) group-context layer, and (c) material payoff game layer.  This framework challenges the "theory of goods" which predicts that humans will overharvest resulting in a 'tragedy of the commons'.  Are researchers willing to participate in a conversation which optmises research funding 
  - [ ] Statistically, the analysis of the experimental subjects during the game will be via a multi-round asymetric payoff table.  Please see the [formulation for this calculation via the Open Source repository for this research](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/evaluation-framework_experiment.md).
      - [ ]  The results from the game will enable each group to be ranked in terms of their collective-action efficiency.  As new rules are added in each iteration of the game, further insights are gained into how each group approaches collective-action problems and the joint strategies (rules) they adopt to achieve a joint optimal outcome.

#### (b) qualitative analysis methods
  - [ ] The decisions individuals make about 'deciding to copperate' (or not) is traditionally based on the 'theory of goods', e.g. without cooperation individuals overuse the resource until it no longer exists aka 'tragedy of the commons'.  However, the hypothesis by Ostrom et al suggests an alternative outcome when CPR resources (like ARC researh grant funding).
  - [ ] The qualitative analysis will reproduce the original field experiment and compare the outcomes of the participants based on their liklihood to cooperate and sustain cooperation.  If the reproduced field experiment mirrors the results of the original experiment it will show that researchers are more likely to cooperate when rule types which empower communication are jointly adopted.
  - [ ] The comparison of the reproduced field experiment, will support the ongoing literature review in the area and contribute to a better understanding of the nuances re theory of goods and how sustainable governance can be achieved over time.

ABOUT COOPERATION IN THE COMMONS by Ostrom & Cardenas

#### (c) institutional analysis and development methods
The 'Institutional Analysis and Development' (IAD) framework is a systematic methodlogy designed by Ostrom et al to understand how institutions operate and change over time given their choice of rules.  As a methodology, the IAD assumes a rational choice model to explain and predict outcomes for how rules can be devised to optimally extract resources for a commons resource.  THe IAD proposes seven rule types: position rules, boundary rules, choice rules, aggregation rules, information rules, payoff rules and scope rules.
 - [ ] The IAD framework will be utilised after the first phase of field experiment research is completed to further experiment with new types of rules (policies, sanctions, etc).  The outcomes from the initial field experiment will be harnessed to improve collective-action rules.
 - [ ] Experimental participant groups will be evaluated according to their governance structure and their social systems by dividing them up into 'action arenas' to understand their practice function as per the IAD's social science methods. 
 - [ ] The final methodological phase of this PHD research will be to 'bridge the theory into practice' by proposing policy changes to Research Funding Councils like the ARC and/or Vice-Chancellors for Research at Universities.  These proposed changes will be written up a IAD case studies and published accordingly.

### Appropriateness & scope
  - [ ] how the methodology addresses your research questions: what can it tell you, what can’t it tell you and what are the tradeoffs you are making?

#### Appropriateness
How does the methodology address your research questions?
 - [ ] Methodology A (empirical well grounded game theory) is the quantiative means by which to measure the percentage of success which the group is achieving as a whole within the context of the game?  
     - [ ] In scope: Are groups of researchers being efficient (Pareto optimal) or are they falling short of their collaborative capability (Nash equillibrium) and/or are they deciding not to participate in the game ('Tragedy of the Commons)?  What patterns of game play are most utilised by different groups of researchers to acheive these different outcomes? If researchers are not achieving optimal efficiency what are the characteristics of their CPR dilemma, and what base game play rules can we learn which avoid collaborative dilemmas?
     - [ ] Out of scope: as the game is a representation of reality, what complexities are missing from the game which would fundamentally change the group behaviours? Is the systemisation of the game too simple to represent reality? 
 - [ ] Methodlogy B (bounded rationality theory) is the qualitative means by which to measure the behavioural outcomes of the research group acting as a collective vs acting as an individual.
     - [ ] In scope: how will the contextual experiment prompt specific behaviours and modes of collective action?  Do these behavioural triggers represent patterns and if so what rules can be put in place to further support or repress these behaviours in other situations?
     - [ ] Out of scope: Are there panaceas which can be learned from this work which are universally applied to all other institutions?  What is the level of abstraction we can assume from these experiment in juxtaposition to the complexities of the 'Ivory Tower'?
 - [ ] Methodlogy C (rational choice model) is the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework which prescribes how the theory of the experiment can be bridged into practice, ideally in the form of new proposed rules (policies and/or sanctions).
     - [ ] In scope: do researchers apply collective action thinking to their day-to-day decisions?  How do researchers think about the value of the resources they are consuming as well as producing?  Who is responsible to the taxpayer for the optimal and efficient use of CPRs?
     - [ ] Out of scope: How does this research apply to instituions outside of the English-speaking University systems, and what loss of value is a result of evaluating a global mono-culture?

  - [ ] Timeline key dates
  - [ ] Gaant chart

### Research project timeline & risks
The start of this part-time PhD occured as the global pandemic ensued, resulting in this work being isolated from the COKI lab and the research team (Western Australia continues to impose severe border restrictions at the time of writing).  Working with the School of Humanities on a thesis addressing 'collaborative research group behaviours' was identified as an "acute juxtaposed irony".
  - [ ] For the ongoing timeline of this research project please see the [Open Source repository for this PhD](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/timeline-milestones.md)

### Timeline
As per Curtin University guidelines for PhD 'thesis via accumulation' it is envisioned that this PhD will have three parts:
  - [ ] 1. Field experiment(s), including the following scholarly outputs:
      - [ ] Publication of field experiment results data, both quantiative game analysis and qualitative interview analysis.
      - [ ] Publication of field experiment in comparison to the original field experiments, as per hypothesised bounded rationlity theory.
  - [ ] 2. Adaption of the field experiment rules (based on iterative experiments with research groups), including the following scholarly outputs:
      - [ ] Reformulation of the empirical well grounded game theory to enable additional rules and asymetric analysis.
