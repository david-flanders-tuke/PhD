# Research Proposal
 - [x] [The below document is based on the template provide by Curtin University for Milestone 1 PhDs](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/FORM-Milestone-1-Application-Form-2021_FlandersTuke.pdf)
 - [x] [Link to presentation slides outlining the below milestone 1 PhD research proposal](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQaziQZt2WtoDWuDPNxD3pmtzHlrsYfD70Yl3GhdKKp6HWHX9wp-zzG6MBXmXgbzP0vaiNSGLir-TPf/pub)

## (I) Title
@Cameron/Karl - please feel free to tickbox the title which you feel has validity, below:
  - [ ] Information marketplaces styles and the design of collaboration-based research products.
  - [ ] The games researchers play: marketplace styles and the design of common pool research resources 
  - [ ] How do researchers decide the games they want to play? - collaboration as means to achieve efficiency for taxpayer funded research
  - [ ] Deciding which marketplaces you want your research outputs to merit?
  - [ ] University library information architectures and their design of collaborative research marketplace pools, aka the future library as a bibliographic bank.

### Abstact(s)
@Cameron/Karl - in an attempt to prototype what a 'final thesis abstract' may look like please find the below suggestions, again, please tickbox any which you feel have relevance:
 - [ ] Global academic publishing companies have succeeded in large part because of the marketplaces they provide researchers to distribute their research outputs.  In order to identify the aspects of the marketplaces that need improvement (and to avoid undesirable modification), a model for a modern marketplace was needed to guide it's design, definition and deployment.
 - [ ] Common pool resource theory provides investigative behavioural economic field experimetns for determining how best to: share and collaborate as a group of researchers, how collaborative research is communicated, how individual research can evolve their researh outputs independently, and how all the above can be described using both formal (quantitative) and informal (qualitative) notations (metadata).  My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the taxpayer-funded marketplace design of research-based products through experimental constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance and social properties desired of a common-pool marketplace.  A proposed marketplace style is investigated in a series of field experiments designed by Ostrom et al.
 - [ ] This dissertation (via cumulation) defines a marketplace framework for understanding common-pool-resources via behavioural-economic styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the marketplace design of network-based research product outputs.  A survey of marketplace styles (game theory) demonstrates how games can be used to classify marketplace styles according to the behavioural properties induced by groups of researchers collaborating to distribute their research products.  I then introduce the <FOO-RESEARCH-BAR> marketplace style and describe how FOOBAR can used to guide the design and development of the University Academic Library information architecture as a modern poly-marketplace arena for knowledge commons products.
 - [ ] Scholarly CPR marketplaces emphasise meritocracy, digital scalability, generality of use for any discpline, independent deployment by libraries and research councils, contractual obligations, enforced secuity of sanctions and encapsulation of legacy library systems.  I describe the behavioural economic principles behind Scholarly CPRs and the interactions constraints chosen to sustain those collaborative marketplace principles, constrasting them to the constraints of other marketplace styles like those of the $10 billion dollar academic publishing industry.  Finally I describe the lessons learned from applying FOOBAR to the Academic sector and their adoption, rejection and adjustment of marketplaces deployed on behalf of their research output products.

## (II) Background 
 Criteria for M1 evaluation:
  - [ ] Literature review of field
  - [ ] Situates the research project within this field

### Literature review
  - Over the past fifty years economics and social science researchers have created new methodologies for evaluating enterprises for public goods, building on traditional economic analysis of entrepreneurship to the private market economy.  Most notable in this endeavor was Elinor Ostrom who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for her "analysis of economic governance, especially the commons", which she shared with Oliver E. Williamson, et al in 2009.  These new research methods provide an opportunity to evaluate Governmental agencies endeavouring to provide public goods.  The focus of this research is the evaluation of 
  - In parallel, the value of the scholarly marketplace is now estimated to exceed ten-billion dollars, making it more valuable than the music industry.  The primary resource which derives economic value 
  - The Australian Research Council acts as the common property resource by which the vast majority of Australian researchers acquire grants and provide publications, all of which are funded by the Australian taxpayer.
