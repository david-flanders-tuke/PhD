## (I) Title
@Cameron/Karl - please feel free to tickbox the title which you feel has validity or suggest another, below:
  - [ ] Information marketplaces and the design of collaboration-based research products
  - [ ] The games researchers play: scholarly marketplace value and the design of common pool research resources 
  - [ ] How do researchers decide the games they want to play? - collaboration as means to achieve efficiency for taxpayer funded research

### Abstact(s)
@Cameron/Karl - in an attempt to prototype what a 'final thesis abstract' _may_ look like please find the below suggestions, again, please tickbox/edit any which you feel have relevance:
 - [ ] Global academic publishing companies have succeeded in large part because of the marketplaces they provide researchers to distribute their research outputs.  In order to identify the aspects of the marketplaces that need improvement (and to avoid undesirable modification), a model for a modern marketplace was needed to guide it's design, definition and deployment.
 - [ ] Common pool resource theory provides investigative behavioural economic field experimetns for determining how best to: share and collaborate as a group of researchers, how collaborative research is communicated, how individual research can evolve their researh outputs independently, and how all the above can be described using both formal (quantitative) and informal (qualitative) notations (metadata).  My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the taxpayer-funded marketplace design of research-based products through experimental constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance and social properties desired of a common-pool marketplace.  A proposed marketplace style is investigated in a series of field experiments designed by Ostrom et al.
 - [ ] This dissertation (via cumulation) defines a marketplace framework for understanding common-pool-resources via behavioural-economic styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the marketplace design of network-based research product outputs.  A survey of marketplace styles (game theory) demonstrates how games can be used to classify marketplace styles according to the behavioural properties induced by groups of researchers collaborating to distribute their research products.  I then introduce a scholarly CPR marketplace 'style' (policies) and describe how behavioural policies can used to guide the design and development of scholarly products as knowledge commons products.
 - [ ] Scholarly CPR marketplaces emphasise meritocracy, digital scalability, generality of use for any discpline, independent deployment by libraries and research councils, contractual obligations, enforced secuity of sanctions and encapsulation of legacy library systems.  I describe the behavioural economic principles behind Scholarly CPRs and the interactions constraints chosen to sustain those collaborative marketplace principles, constrasting them to the constraints of other marketplace styles like those of the $10 billion dollar academic publishing industry.  Finally I describe the lessons learned from applying Scholarly CPR marketplaces to the Academic sector and their adoption, rejection and adjustment of marketplaces deployed on behalf of their research output products.

## (II) Background 
@Cameron/Karl, below is the M1 criteria for this section, please feel free to add any additional crtieria which you would like expoounded:
  - [ ] Literature review of field
  - [ ] Situates the research project within the field

### Literature review
  - Over the past fifty years economics and social science researchers have created new methodologies for evaluating enterprises for public goods, building on traditional economic analysis of entrepreneurship to the private market economy.  Most notable in this endeavor was Elinor Ostrom who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for her "analysis of economic governance, especially the commons", which she shared with Oliver E. Williamson, et al in 2009.  These new research methods provide an opportunity to evaluate Governmental agencies endeavouring to provide public goods.  The focus of this research is the evaluation of 'common property resources' as provided by the Australian taxpayer.
  - The value of the scholarly marketplace worldwide is now estimated to exceed ten-billion dollars, making it more valuable than the music industry.  The primary resource which derives economic value from this marketplace is the scholarly research publication which is primarily funded by the taxpayer in the USA (National Science Foundation, National Institute of Health, etc), UK (Medical Research Council, Higher Education Funding Council of England), EU (European Commision) and Australasia (Australian Research Council).
  - The Australian Research Council (ARC) acts as the primary entrepreneur which delegates taxpayer funds as a common property resource to Australian researchers via a research grant marketplace.  Accordingly, for the purpose of this evaluation the research grant marketplace provided by the ARC is defined as a 'public good' because the funds provided are not easy to exlude nor __________________ #exclusive #determinate #?.
  - The New Instittutional Economic methods for evaluating public good marketplaces, like the ARC, are dictated by the mathematcial modelling of game theory.  Specifically, the game known as the 'prisoner's dilemma' or 'tragedy of the commons' provides the base combinatorial matrix by which public goods can be interrogated for their efficiency, or rather lack of efficiency defined as a 'Common Property Resource (CPR) dilemma'.
  - The catalyst for evaluating group efficiency (or non-cooperative CPR dilemmas) was the field experiments carried out by Ostrom and Cardenas in 1996 in South America.  These field experiments brought together groups of local Colombian farmers to evaluate their group interactions and what, if any, efficiencies and/or dilemmas arose.  Accordingly, the first part of this PhD research is a replication of this field experiment applied to local Australian research groups. 
  - The hypothetical research questions which arise in these field experiments are two fold: (a) for research groups who are not efficient in their use of taxpayer funding (aka face CPR dilemmas), what behaviourval regularities emerge in the development of improved group collaboration theories, and (b) what types of institutional variables (physical, virtual and policy rules) affect the liklihood of successful resolution of CPR dilemmas?
 
### Potential value of research within the field
@Cameron/Karl - I've provided situational evidence by which the research could have value to several field of inquiry, your vote via checkbox is much appreciated:
  - [ ] The rise of the 'Open Access' movement has questioned the value which taxpayers receive via government funded research council grants. This research will provide a repeatable experiment whereby small groups of likeminded researchers (5-8 people) can self-evaluate themselves as a group to determine their collaborative efficiency.
  - [ ] With the rise of databases the ability by governments to track and enforce policy rules has increased significantly, as primarily evidenced by China's surveilance regime under the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Xi Jinping's administration.  These monitorring and sanctioning methods have increased significantly worldwide, especially in Australia via COVID related policy rules and border enforcement.  University administrations are increasingly monitorring and sancitoning researchers in accordance with institutional policy requirements.  How do we know if these policy rules are actually afffective? This research will investigate the value of top down-policy reform and its effecitveness in regulating efficiency of collaborative research groups.

## (III) [Methodology and Methods](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/methodology.md)
M1 criteria for this section:
  - [ ] research methodlogy
  - [ ] appropriateness & scope in/out

### Research methodology
The theorectical foundations proposed by Ostrom et al for common property resource dilemmas are: (a) empircal well grounded theory, and (b) bounded rationality theory.  Both of these theories are interrogated via the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework (IAD) which prescribes the following methodologies and field experiment methods for the first phase of this research:
  - [ ] The formal experimentation methodology which will be used is 'non cooperative game theory' which fundamentally relies on the 'prisoner's dilemma' matrix to evaluate the individual and group decisions during the field experiment.
      - [ ] The first phase of this research reproduces the original field experiment, but with a tradeoff in participant ?socio-economic? status: where the orginal participants were rural farmers from Columbia South America, the subjects in this study are University researchers in Australia.  Accordingly, the comparison of these two experimental subjects will juxtapose 'bounded rationality theory', e.g. rural colombian farmers vs Australian academics?
  - [ ] Statistically, the analysis of the experimental subjects during the game asymetric payoff tables
  - [ ] NB for the purposes of this doctoral research being conducted in the school of humanities as a 'thesis via accumulation', the componets of this thesis
