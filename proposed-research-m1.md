## 1. Title and Abstract 
Thesis title(s)
  - [ ] Information marketplaces styles and the design of collaboration-based research products.
  - [ ] The games researchers play: marketplace styles and the design of common pool research resources 
  - [ ] How do researchers decide the games they want to play?
  - [ ] Deciding which marketplaces you want your research outputs to merit?
  - [ ] University library information architectures and their design of collaborative research marketplace pools, aka the future library as a bibliographic bank.

Abstact(s)
 - [ ] Global academic publishing companies have succeeded in large part because of the marketplaces they provide researchers to distribute their research outputs.  In order to identify the aspects of the marketplaces that need improvement (and to avoid undesirable modification), a model for a modern marketplace was needed to guide it's design, definition and deployment.
 - [ ] Common pool resource theory provides investigative behavioural economic field experimetns for determining how best to: share and collaborate as a group of researchers, how collaborative research is communicated, how individual research can evolve their researh outputs independently, and how all the above can be described using both formal (quantitative) and informal (qualitative) notations (metadata).  My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the taxpayer-funded marketplace design of research-based products through experimental constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance and social properties desired of a common-pool marketplace.  A proposed marketplace style is investigated in a series of field experiments designed by Ostrom et al.
 - [ ] This dissertation (via cumulation) defines a marketplace framework for understanding common-pool-resources via behavioural-economic styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the marketplace design of network-based research product outputs.  A survey of marketplace styles (game theory) demonstrates how games can be used to classify marketplace styles according to the behavioural properties induced by groups of researchers collaborating to distribute their research products.  I then introduce the <FOO-RESEARCH-BAR> marketplace style and describe how FOOBAR can used to guide the design and development of the University Academic Library information architecture as a modern poly-marketplace arena for knowledge commons products.
 - [ ] FOOBAR marketplaces emphasise meritocracy, digital scalability, generality of use for any discpline, independent deployment by libraries and research councils, contractual obligations, enforced secuity of sanctions and encapsulation of legacy library systems.  I describe the behavioural economic principles behind FOOBAR and the interactions constraints chosen to sustain those collaborative marketplace principles, constrasting them to the constraints of other marketplace styles like those of the $10billion dollar academic publishing industry.  Finally I describe the lessons learned from applying FOOBAR to the Academic sector and their adoption, rejection and adjustment of marketplaces deployed on behalf of their research output products.
