# Experimental participants
KW: As you know you will need HREC Ethics approval for the human participants but it's likely to be considered Low risk and reviewed by someone in MCASI.
 - [ ] In the HREC application you will need to specify recruitment plans and also the set of questions you'll be asking participants.
 - [ ] I think you will need to do two HREC applications - one before you undertake the alpha experiment, and the second in time for the beta experiment.
 - [ ] So it's important to start preparing the 1st alpha HREC app so that you are ready for doing that in Q2 2022. How many do you want for the alpha experiment? Are there enough researchers in COKI? If not you could probably expand to others in MCASI.
