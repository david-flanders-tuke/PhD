## Game theory hypothesis
Can we collectively spend taxpayer resources more efficiently?
 - [ ] How to optimise decision making by a group of researchers to optimally and longitudally use a CPR?
 - [ ] Policy report to taxpayer: we your researchers are striving to achieve optimal outcomes for burden sharing and improvement?
### Field experimental theory
Cardenas, Ostrom, et al
  - [ ] "groups of individuals in public good environment tend to achieve more efficient outcomes than Nash equilibrium outcomes"
  - [ ] burden sharing in achieving better-than-Nash equillibrium outcomes
  - [ ] subjects are asked to decide how much time to devote to collecting <grants/publishing>, and how much to devote to an alternative market pursuit such as wage labour (experimentation) or farming one's own land (increasing h-index).
  - [ ] Time spent grant collecting has adverse environmental consequences (soil erosion, water quality); ergo restraint collecting the CPR:firewood/grants which benefits all in the community.
  - [ ] burden sharing in the exploitation of common pool resource problems (vs public good problems).
  - [ ] Two experiment treatments: symetric returns vs asymetric returns: average returns to the market alternative (per unit of effort) ar the same in both the sym and asym. Nash equilibria of both treatments yield the same aggregate amount of time spent collecting firewood ergo local water quality.
  - [ ] Disciplinarity as economic inequality: for common pool experiments Hackett1994 vary the exogenous endowment of an input across individuals.

### [New Institutional Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_institutional_economics)
Oliver E. Williamson, The new institutional economics: taking stock, looking ahead. Sept 2000
  - [ ] 'institutions do matter' and 'the determinants of institutions are susceptible to analysis by the tools of economic theory' (Mathews).
  - [ ] Economics of institution levels: L1: social theory, L2 economics of property (political theory), L3 transaction cost economics, L4 neoclassical economicy (agency theory).
  - [ ] Level 1: evolutionary, cultural symbolic value, protect against alien values
  - [ ] Level 2: propertry rules, both (i) informal constraints (sanctions, constraints, taboos, customs, traditions, codes of conduct) and (ii) formal constraints/rules (constitutions, laws, property rights).  Traditionally controlled by government, including executive, legislative and judicial (federalism)
