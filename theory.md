## Questions/hypothesis of behavioural decision making
Questions:
 - [ ] Can institutions collectively spend taxpayer resources more efficiently?
 - [ ] Is there an economics of citation, e.g. libaries as collective action banks?
 - [ ] PhDs students as low income wage/citation earners vs professors as high wage/citation earners; terehby resulting in collectivce action theory that it is the low income earners who enable pareto collaboration?
 - [ ] Are citation highly subtractable and excludability difficult?  And how are they mined from taxpayer funds?
 - [ ] Not all citation are weighted the same? Does a social socience citation costs more than a science publication to produce?
 - [ ] How to optimise decision making by a group of researchers to optimally and longitudally use a CPR?
 - [ ] Policy report to taxpayer: we your researchers are striving to achieve optimal outcomes for burden sharing and improvement?
 - [ ] Is their an opportunity (in the longitudal historical economic paradigm) for a revolution in on-mass delivery of education?  Ergo the availability of taxpayer funds to once again shift the focus of the institution back onto a delivery of education via more complete research lead projects?
 - [ ] What if we instead imagined The Australian Research Act as a kind of natural resource, like the Aboriginal and Crown land of the Great Australian Divide?  What is each dollar in that 815 million dollar taxpayer fund represented a forest, water system and/or indigenous animal? NB ironically, in some way these dollars do represent varying ecosystems as they are spent on protecting priceless envioronments on one of the oldest inhabited continents on earth.  Ironically, it becomes our duty as researchers to hold one another accountable and sanctionable, as we are acting on behalf of the things we want to last beyond the holocene.

### Field experimental game theory 
Collective action economics theory by Ostrom, Cardenas, et al

### Ostrom: [Beyond markets and states: polycentric governance of complex economic systems](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/ostrom_lecture.pdf)
 - [ ] Beyond market and state: outcomes for diverse institutional arrangements for governing common-pool resources (CPRs) and public goods at multiple scales.
 - [ ] the humans we study have complex motivational  structures and establish diverse private-for-profit, governmental, and  community institutional arrangements that operate at multiple  scales to generate  productive and innovative as well as destructive and perverse outcomes.
 - [ ] simply  allowing  communication, or “cheap talk,” enables participants to reduce overharvesting and increase joint payoffs, contrary to game-theoretical predictions (Cardenas)
 - [ ] 1954 Paul Samuelson (1954) divided goods into two types: excludable and rivalrous; public goods are both non-excludable and non rivalrous aka difficult to disclude and easily errodable (subtractable).  No longer was the world filled with actors who were either consumers or voters.  
 - [ ] 1965 Additional product types like "club goods", "toll goods" "common pool goods" have been identified since (Buchanan)
 - [ ] rational individuals (fully capable) know all strategies, outcomes per strategy and their rank order for utilitarian value to themselves, such as expected profits.
 - [ ] 1961 Polycentricty of institutional agencies has the potential to be productive (V.Ostrom, Tiebout, Warren), e.g. SMC (small-medium cities) are more effective in: monitorring transaction costs, enable citizen to vote with their feet and allow incorporated communities to contract competively.
 - [ ] 1993 proof that complexity is not the same as chaos in regards to governance.

#### Research notes re assymetric payoff table for field experiment
  - [ ] "groups of individuals in public good environment tend to achieve more efficient outcomes than Nash equilibrium outcomes"
  - [ ] burden sharing in achieving better-than-Nash equillibrium outcomes
  - [ ] subjects are asked to decide how much time to devote to collecting <grants/publishing>, and how much to devote to an alternative market pursuit such as wage labour (experimentation) or farming one's own land (increasing h-index).
  - [ ] Time spent grant collecting has adverse environmental consequences (soil erosion, water quality); ergo restraint collecting the CPR:firewood/grants which benefits all in the community.
  - [ ] burden sharing in the exploitation of common pool resource problems (vs public good problems).
  - [ ] Two experiment treatments: symetric returns vs asymetric returns: average returns to the market alternative (per unit of effort) ar the same in both the sym and asym. Nash equilibria of both treatments yield the same aggregate amount of time spent collecting firewood ergo local water quality.
  - [ ] Disciplinarity as economic inequality: for common pool experiments Hackett1994 vary the exogenous endowment of an input across individuals.

### [New Institutional Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_institutional_economics)
Oliver E. Williamson, [The new institutional economics: taking stock, looking ahead](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2565421) Sept 2000
  - [ ] 'institutions do matter' and 'the determinants of institutions are susceptible to analysis by the tools of economic theory' (Mathews).
  - [ ] Economics of institution hierarchical pyramid levels: *L1* (100-1000 years): social theory embedded like institution, customs, traditions, norms, regligions, etc, *L2* (10-100 years) economics of property (political theory) like property, polity, judiciary, bureaucracy, etc, *L3* (1-10 years) transaction cost economics like governance, contracts, play of the game, etc *L4* (continous) neoclassical economicy (agency theory) like prices, quantities and incentive alignment, etc.
  - [ ] the opportunities for change at each of the above levels varies in time length exponentially at each level, ergo opportunities for change are historical incidences which history has recorded in multiple civilisations, e.g. federalist papers resulting in an independent government constituating in a judicial, legislative and executive branches of power; 
  - [ ]  "truly among man's innovations, the use  of organization to accomplish his ends  is among both his greatest and his earliest" (Arrow 1971). We cannot  fail, however, to be awed by the pro-  found importance of technological inno-  vation (Robert Fogel 1999). Inasmuch  as these two work in tandem, we need  to find ways to treat technical and or-  ganizational innovation in a combined  manner.
  - [ ]  "Note that the common practice of condemning public bureaus because they have  lower-powered incentives, more rules  and regulations, and greater job security than a counterpart firm completely  misses the point. These features have  been deliberately crafted into the pub-  lic bureau, thereby to make it better  suited to govern some (especially difficult) transactions.6 Vigilance is nonetheless needed-lest the public bureau  be "overused."
