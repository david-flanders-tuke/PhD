## Questions/hypothesis of behavioural decision making
Questions:
 - [ ] Can institutions collectively spend taxpayer resources more efficiently?
 - [ ] Is there an economics of citation, e.g. libaries as collective action banks?
 - [ ] PhDs students as low income wage/citation earners vs professors as high wage/citation earners; terehby resulting in collectivce action theory that it is the low income earners who enable pareto collaboration?
 - [ ] Are citation highly subtractable and excludability difficult?  And how are they mined from taxpayer funds?
 - [ ] Not all citation are weighted the same? Does a social socience citation costs more than a science publication to produce?
 - [ ] How to optimise decision making by a group of researchers to optimally and longitudally use a CPR?
 - [ ] Policy report to taxpayer: we your researchers are striving to achieve optimal outcomes for burden sharing and improvement?
 - [ ] Is their an opportunity (in the longitudal historical economic paradigm) for a revolution in on-mass delivery of education?  Ergo the availability of taxpayer funds to once again shift the focus of the institution back onto a delivery of education via more complete research lead projects?

### Field experimental game theory 
Collective action economics theory by Ostrom, Cardenas, et al

#### Research notes re assymetric payoff table for field experiment
  - [ ] "groups of individuals in public good environment tend to achieve more efficient outcomes than Nash equilibrium outcomes"
  - [ ] burden sharing in achieving better-than-Nash equillibrium outcomes
  - [ ] subjects are asked to decide how much time to devote to collecting <grants/publishing>, and how much to devote to an alternative market pursuit such as wage labour (experimentation) or farming one's own land (increasing h-index).
  - [ ] Time spent grant collecting has adverse environmental consequences (soil erosion, water quality); ergo restraint collecting the CPR:firewood/grants which benefits all in the community.
  - [ ] burden sharing in the exploitation of common pool resource problems (vs public good problems).
  - [ ] Two experiment treatments: symetric returns vs asymetric returns: average returns to the market alternative (per unit of effort) ar the same in both the sym and asym. Nash equilibria of both treatments yield the same aggregate amount of time spent collecting firewood ergo local water quality.
  - [ ] Disciplinarity as economic inequality: for common pool experiments Hackett1994 vary the exogenous endowment of an input across individuals.

### [New Institutional Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_institutional_economics)
Oliver E. Williamson, [The new institutional economics: taking stock, looking ahead](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2565421) Sept 2000
  - [ ] 'institutions do matter' and 'the determinants of institutions are susceptible to analysis by the tools of economic theory' (Mathews).
  - [ ] Economics of institution hierarchical pyramid levels: *L1* (100-1000 years): social theory embedded like institution, customs, traditions, norms, regligions, etc, *L2* (10-100 years) economics of property (political theory) like property, polity, judiciary, bureaucracy, etc, *L3* (1-10 years) transaction cost economics like governance, contracts, play of the game, etc *L4* (continous) neoclassical economicy (agency theory) like prices, quantities and incentive alignment, etc.
  - [ ] the opportunities for change at each of the above levels varies in time length exponentially at each level, ergo opportunities for change are historical incidences which history has recorded in multiple civilisations, e.g. federalist papers resulting in an independent government constituating in a judicial, legislative and executive branches of power;

We cannot  fail, however, to be awed by the pro-  found importance of technological inno-  vation (Robert Fogel 1999). Inasmuch  as these two work in tandem, we need  to find ways to treat technical and or-  ganizational innovation in a combined  manner.

These features have  been deliberately crafted into the pub-  lic bureau, thereby to make it better  suited to govern some (especially difficult) transactions.6 Vigilance is nonetheless needed-lest the public bureau  be "overused."
