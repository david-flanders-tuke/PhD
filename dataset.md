## Processing the datasets produced from the experiment
Two datasets are produced from the experiment, the first is a quantitative dataset which must be processed by the asymetrical payoff table formula; the second is a qualitative dataset which is interpretted by evaluating the interviews against a framework for decision making motivations:
 - [ ] Quantitative dataset of collective scores from group game play:
   * The formula and scripts for processing the scores from each round of the game against the asymetric payoff table are below...
   * The categorisation of groups is framed by the Australian Government's R&D taxpayer funding, as administered by the ARC, NHMRC and ABS, below... 

 - [ ] Qualitative dataset of interviews from each participant on the motivation behind their game-play decisions:
   * The theoretical framework for framing each interview is outlined below...
   * The frameworks used for evaluating each group in the field experiment, is below...

## Research funding as discipline based 'common pool resource' defined by Australian government
The structuring of the field-experiment requires participants to self-select their participation by identifiying themselves as researcher who actively participate in a common research division, discpline and subject (as defined by the Australian Government's Bureau of Statistic).
