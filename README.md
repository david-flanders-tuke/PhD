# Experiment in collective action theory
This repository provides all the information and guides required to run a field experiment in collective action socioeconomics for the purpose of evaluating research group optimisation. The purpose of this repository is to enable research organisations to evaluate the optimal use of common pool resources like taxpayer funded grants to researchers.  [If you are interested in running this experiment and sharing your results please contact the COKI Lab at Curtin University](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/about.md).

Invitation to experiment:
  - [x] Librarians and other University administrative centres responsible for calculating research values
  - [x] PhD students and local labs wanting an insight into how a research group can most efficiently cooperate
  - [x] Research funding council programme managers and other research grant funding bodies who would like to evaluate how best to enable optimal use of reserch fudning grants.

## Purpose of experiment
 - [ ] Evaluate cooperation tactics (via game theory) of researchers' use of common pool resources, e.g. what is the most efficient way to use taxpayer funds like the Australian Research Council's common funding pools?

### Experiment outcomes
The experiment, will result in two datasets: 
 - [ ] (i) a quantitative dataset showing each experimental research group utilised common pool resources, e.g. each research group can be classified as pareto optimal, nash equilibrium and/or tragedy of the commons; and, 
 - [ ] (ii) a qualitative thematic analysis dataset for each individual and the motivation behind each of their choices in the group, e.g. material payoff motivation, group-context motivation, and/or self-identity motivation.

## Literature review
 - [ ] Theoretical: socioeconomics aka new institutional economics and collective action theory.
 - [ ] Field experiment: game-theory (nash equilibrium, pareto optimal, tragedy of the commons) and cooperation behavioural governance.
 - [ ] Experimental analysis: quantitative *&* qualitative.

## Methodlogies for field experiment
 - [ ] Qualitative: analysis of individual's survey data on social-behavioural decision making
 - [ ] Quantiative: statistical prediction for group behaviour's liklihood of optimisation 

## Administration of field experiment
 - [ ] Invites to participants and required experimental permissions
 - [ ] Instruction for administering the experiment by a monitor
 - [ ] Post experiment survey and interviews
 - [ ] Data collective from experiment and statistical interpretation
 - [ ] Experimental results and recommendations

## Approvals for field experiment
