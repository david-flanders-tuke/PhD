# Field experiment aim
The aim of this repository is to provide the guides required to run a field experiment with research groups for the purpose of evaluating collaborative marketplace researcher optimisation. The objectives of the field experiment are:
  1. empower researcher to agree the shared value they will derive by declaring their prefered maketplaces for research outputs;
  2. engender research organisations to keep their marketplace outputs accountable and meritable, esp University promotions; and
  3. enable research funding organisations to evaluate the optimal use of common pool resources, e.g. ARC taxpayer funded grants to researchers.  

[If you are interested in running this experiment and sharing your results please contact the COKI Lab at Curtin University](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/about.md).

## Invitation to experiment
We would humbly invite field experiment facilitators, esp University administrators:
 - [x] librarians, commercialisation and other University administrative centres responsible for calculating research value;
 - [x] postgraduate students and local labs wanting an insight into optimal research group collaboration evaluation,
 - [x] research funding councils and other research grant funding bodies who would like to evaluate how best to enable optimal use of reserch funding grants; and
 - [x] publishers looking to support their customers with the marketplaces for their research outputs.

Katie: 
 - different 
 - MCASI 2x groups of 5-7ppl

### On this page: what you'll need to run the field experiment
 - [x] purpose of the field experiment and supporting literature review;
 - [x] methodology of field experiment and participation requirements;
 - [x] administering the field experiment to participants on the day; 
 - [x] analysis of the data generated from the field experiment;
 - [x] delivery of results from field experiment and ethical implications; and
 - [x] metadata of who supports the field experiment.

## [Experiment purpose](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/theory.md)
Who derives value?
 - [ ] What is the value which research groups will gain by participating in this experiment?
 - [ ] What value will research organisations like Universities gain by encouraging their researchers to participate in this experiment?
 - [ ] Why should research funding coucils care about the outcomes of these experiments and the implications it has for taxpayer funded research grants?

What value is manifested?
 - [ ] Evaluate and make explicit cooperation tactics (via game theory) of researchers' use of common pool resources, e.g. what is the most efficient way to use taxpayer funds like the Australian Research Council's common funding pools? 
 - [ ]  How can industry derive value from the R&D from scholars?

Why does the experiment make research marketplaces product values explicit for each group of researcher's who participate?
 - [ ] Theoretical: socioeconomics aka new institutional economics and collective action theory.
 - [ ] Field experiment: game-theory (nash equilibrium, pareto optimal, tragedy of the commons) and cooperation behavioural governance.

How are the results of the field experiment communicated and what implications (call to action) are derived from each experiment?
 - [ ] Experimental analysis: quantitative *&* qualitative.
 - [ ] There are no panaceas!

Where and when does the group experiment take place?
 - [ ] Where: Virtual vs Real-Lyf?
 - [ ] When: prep and post timelines

Katie:
 - timeliine for ethics
 - if low risk embarrassment - information sheet for participants? - you will be working with others - tick box that they have read it: "I am aware I will be participating and sharing my ideas with others in my group" - they can't compain that they didn't know this would be happening.

 - [ ] [Invites to participants and required experimental permissions](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/participants.md)
 - [ ] Instruction for administering the experiment by a monitor
 - [ ] Post experiment survey and interviews
 - [ ] Data collective from experiment and statistical interpretation
 - [ ] Experimental results and recommendations

Katie:
 - recruitment invitation nees to be a range of people and why it is important to have that wider group 
 - gender equality - 
 - disciplinary but bound together around a common bond.
 - Aboriginal and/or Torres Straight Islanders researchers would require full ethics approval: Maori researchers have said it is not their's to share.
 - Katie to send research on aborginal and torres straight islanders.

## [Experiment data analysis](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/dataset.md)
The experiment, will result in two datasets: 
 - [ ] (a) quantitative statistical prediction for the liklihood of group optimisation: each experimental group will be categorised according to the "bids" they put forward in each round of the game. The analysis of the group participation will categorise each group into which kind of marketplace they prefer their research to engender: Pareto optimal (work collaboratively to optimise taxpayer funds), Nash equilibrium (contractually divide up funds) and/or tragedy of commons (keep their research to themselves).
 - [ ] (b) qualitative interview analysis of individual's survey data on social-behavioural decision making: after the game-experiment a transcribed interview with each participant will take place, which will go through each round of the game and the scores they provided to evaluate their individual (internal behavioural) decision model. The original framework for the model is a three layer onion: individual value, shared group value and perceived payoff value. 

The evaluation for (a) and (b) datasets as custom insights for University and Research Council insights into each research group could include:
 1. Understanding for the values which each group of discipline researchers have for either sharing their work and/or collaborating with other researchers
 2. Categorisation of research groups in terms of their liklihood to collaborate with other interdiscplinary research groups
 3. Wider understanding for the types of marketplaces which researchers want their research exposed to and how researcher expect value to be generated by their research being shared.

## [Experiment approvals](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/ethic.md)
The following list of documents provide evidence by Curtin University for conduting a research experiment on humans as part of PhD research:
 - [x] Ethics approval for human experimentation aka embarrassing behaviour during a game-like workshop
 - [ ] To share or not to share?!  How our data can help Curtin University build a larger map of scholarly knowledge marketplaces.
