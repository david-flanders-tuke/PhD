# Field experiment aim
The aim of this repository is to provide all the information and guides required to run a field experiment with research groups for the purpose of evaluating collaborative marketplace optimisation. The objectives of the field experiment are:
  1. empower researcher to agree the shared value they will derive by declaring which marketplaces will derive value from their research outputs;
  2. engender research organisations to keep their marketplace outputs accountable and meritable, esp University promotions; and
  3. enable research funding organisations to evaluate the optimal use of common pool resources, e.g. ARC taxpayer funded grants to researchers.  

[If you are interested in running this experiment and sharing your results please contact the COKI Lab at Curtin University](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/about.md).

## Invitation to experiment
We would humbly invite field experiment facilitators, esp University administrators:
 - [x] librarians and other University administrative centres responsible for calculating research value;
 - [x] PhD students and local labs wanting an insight into research group collaboration; and
 - [x] research funding councils and other research grant funding bodies who would like to evaluate how best to enable optimal use of reserch funding grants.

### On this page: what you'll need to run the field experiment
 - [x] purpose of the field experiment and supporting literature review;
 - [x] methodology of field experiment and participation requirements;
 - [x] administering the field experiment to [participants](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/participants.md) on the day;
 - [x] analysis of the data generated from the field experiment;
 - [x] delivery of results from field experiment and ethical implications; and
 - [x] metadata of who supports the field experiment; and

## Purpose of experiment
 - [ ] Evaluate cooperation tactics (via game theory) of researchers' use of common pool resources, e.g. what is the most efficient way to use taxpayer funds like the Australian Research Council's common funding pools?

## [Experiment literature review](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/theory.md)
 - [ ] Theoretical: socioeconomics aka new institutional economics and collective action theory.
 - [ ] Field experiment: game-theory (nash equilibrium, pareto optimal, tragedy of the commons) and cooperation behavioural governance.
 - [ ] Experimental analysis: quantitative *&* qualitative.

## [Experiment facilitation and methodology](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/methodology.md)
 - [ ] Invites to participants and required experimental permissions
 - [ ] Instruction for administering the experiment by a monitor
 - [ ] Post experiment survey and interviews
 - [ ] Data collective from experiment and statistical interpretation
 - [ ] Experimental results and recommendations

## [Experiment data analysis](https://github.com/david-flanders-tuke/PhD/blob/main/dataset.md)
The experiment, will result in two datasets: 
 - [x] (a) quantitative: each experimental group will be categorised according to the "bids" they put forward in each round of the game. The analysis of the group participation will categorise each group into which kind of marketplace they prefer their research to engender: Pareto optimal (work collaboratively to optimise taxpayer funds), Nash equilibrium (contractually divide up funds) and/or tragedy of commons (keep their research to themselves).
 - [ ] (b) qualitative: after the game-experiment a transcribed interview with each participant will take place, which will go through each round of the game and the scores they provided to evaluate their individual (internal behavioural) decision model. The original framework for the model is a three layer onion: individual value, shared group value and perceived payoff value. 

The evaluation for (a) and (b) as custom insights for University and Research Council insights into each research group could include:
 1. Understanding for the values which each group of discipline researchers have for either sharing their work and/or collaborating with other researchers
 2. Categorisation of research groups in terms of their liklihood to collaborate with other interdiscplinary research groups
 3. Wider understanding for the types of marketplaces which researchers want their research exposed to and how researcher expect value to be generated by their research being shared.

 - [ ] Qualitative: analysis of individual's survey data on social-behavioural decision making
 - [ ] Quantiative: statistical prediction for group behaviour's liklihood of optimisation
