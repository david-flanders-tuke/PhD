# Field experiment: collective action by researchers arising from use of common pool resource dilemmas

This experiment will investigate the collective-action dilemma which groups of researchers face when accessing common-pool resources (such as taxpayer funded research grants, like the Australian Research Council).  The experiment hypothesizes three outcomes for the participants: (i) defection from the group (aka 'tragedy of the commons'), (ii) self-promotion in the group (Nash equilibrium), and/or (iii) cooperation in the group (Pareto social optimisation).  The decision making process for each researcher in the group experiment, will be individually evaluated against an economic theory of public good or common-pool resources. 

The following research experiment is a replication of the field experiement which Juan-Camilo Cardenas and Elinor Ostrom conducted with three rural villages in Columbia (1998) to explore their use of local forestry resources for individual benefit between 1994-2004.  Below is a summary of the research produced on those experiments and how those game-theory experiments have been adapted for by research groups accessing common pool taxpayer funds, like ARC funding.

Theoretically, the experimental-game asks questions about the percieved "contemporary" economic theory ("theory of goods") which explains collective human behaviour based on the "normal economic" setting of: 
  - [ ] exchange of private goods in an open competitive market
  - [ ] goods involved are easily excludable and rivalrous
  - [ ] individuals are interacting in a competitive market

The experimental-game questions the above "normal economic" theoretical predictions by proposing an alternative empirical condition:
  - [x] what if the goods in the game are not easy to exclude[1], e.g. the goods are common property resources which "anyone" can access?
  - [x] what if the participants accessing the goods are encouraged to participate in an iterative conversation on how to access the goods [2] (vs an open competive market with 'single-shot' sales)?
  - [x] what if a cultural norm for "cheap talk" is encouraged (via policy) whereby non-binding "contractual" conversation is allowed[3]?

Why should experimental field research be conducted with researchers to ascertain how to optimise their use of CPR taxpayer funds?
 - [ ] Researchers accessing taxpayer funds from common pool taxpayer resources face a major challenge to be placed within a theoretical construct of human behaviour where classical economical models could be applied to the exchange of goods in full-information market settings. 
 - [ ] Researchers have a wider range of motivations when they individually use CPR systems that are made up of non-private goods (Hirschmann 1985), like research council funding.
 - [ ] A broader framework is required to propose a theoretical synthesis for researcher's economic behaviours:
     - [ ] the types of norms adopted by individuals, 
     - [ ] the importance of group characteristics, 
     - [ ] the possibilities for using reputation and reciprocity, and 
     - [ ] the specific rules used in particular settings.

[1]= previous research suggests that these games will end in a "tragedy of the comons" where the resource is accessed until depleted, e.g. in repeated games, the average level of contribution starts at around 50 percent but, without opportunities for communication, slowly decays toward the predicted zero level (Ledyard 1995).
[2]= neoclassical theory for individuals maximizing material payoffs predicts that individuals tend to contribute, on average, between 40 to 60 percent of their (experimentally) assigned assets in a one-shot game (Davis and Holt 1993; Isaac and Walker 1988).
[3]= Subjects who are able to sustain cooperation in public good experiments for long periods of time (near optimal Pareto withdrawal levels) are able to outperform competitive markets when they are able to communicate, come to their own agreements, and use agreed-upon punishments if someone deviates from from the agreement (Sally 1995; Isaac and Walker 1988) (Ostrom et al, 1994).
