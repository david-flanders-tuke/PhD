# Field experiment: collective action by researchers arising from use of common pool resource dilemmas

This experiment will investigate the collective-action dilemma which groups of researchers face when accessing common-pool resources (such as taxpayer funded research grants, like the Australian Research Council).  The experiment hypothesizes three outcomes for the participants: (i) defection from the group (aka 'tragedy of the commons'), (ii) self-promotion in the group (Nash equilibrium), and/or (iii) cooperation in the group (Pareto social optimisation).  The decision making process for each researcher in the group experiment, will be individually evaluated against an economic theory of public good or common-pool resources. 

The following research experiment is a replication of the field experiement which Juan-Camilo Cardenas and Elinor Ostrom conducted with three rural villages in Columbia (1998) to explore their use of local forestry resources for individual benefit between 1994-2004.  Below is a summary of the research produced on those experiments and how those game-theory experiments have been adapted for by research groups accessing common pool taxpayer funds, like ARC funding.

Theoretically, the experimental-game asks questions about the percieved "contemporary" economic theory ("theory of goods") which explains collective human behaviour based on the "normal economic" setting of: 
  - [ ] exchange of private goods in an open competitive market
  - [ ] goods involved are easily excludable and rivalrous
  - [ ] individuals are interacting in a competitive market

The experimental-game questions the above "normal economic" theoretical predictions by proposing an alternative empirical condition:
  - [x] what if the goods in the game are not easy to exclude[1], e.g. the goods are common property resources which "anyone" can access?
  - [x] what if the participants accessing the goods are encouraged to participate in an iterative conversation on how to access the goods [2] (vs an open competive market with 'single-shot' sales)?
  - [x] what if a cultural norm for "cheap talk" is encouraged (via policy) whereby non-binding "contractual" conversation is allowed[3]?

Why should experimental field research be conducted with researchers to ascertain how to optimise their use of CPR taxpayer funds?
 - [ ] Researchers accessing taxpayer funds from common pool taxpayer resources face a major challenge to be placed within a theoretical construct of human behaviour where classical economical models could be applied to the exchange of goods in full-information market settings. 
 - [ ] Researchers have a wider range of motivations when they individually use CPR systems that are made up of non-private goods (Hirschmann 1985), like research council funding.
 - [ ] A broader framework is required to propose a theoretical synthesis for researcher's economic behaviours:
     - [ ] the types of norms adopted by individuals, 
     - [ ] the importance of group characteristics, 
     - [ ] the possibilities for using reputation and reciprocity, and 
     - [ ] the specific rules used in particular settings.

Nota bena:
  - [1]= previous research suggests that these games will end in a "tragedy of the comons" where the resource is accessed until depleted, e.g. in repeated games, the average level of contribution starts at around 50 percent but, without opportunities for communication, slowly decays toward the predicted zero level (Ledyard 1995).
  - [2]= neoclassical theory for individuals maximizing material payoffs predicts that individuals tend to contribute, on average, between 40 to 60 percent of their (experimentally) assigned assets in a one-shot game (Davis and Holt 1993; Isaac and Walker 1988).
  - [3]= Subjects who are able to sustain cooperation in public good experiments for long periods of time (near optimal Pareto withdrawal levels) are able to outperform competitive markets when they are able to communicate, come to their own agreements, and use agreed-upon punishments if someone deviates from from the agreement (Sally 1995; Isaac and Walker 1988) (Ostrom et al, 1994).

## Why should researcher groups want to play this game?
  - [ ] If researchers are expected to work collaboratively, then understanding the expectations for the outputs which are achieved on behalf of the taxpayer should be made explicit within the research group.
  - [ ] Understanding how individual researchers learn about and interpret the information potentially available to them in a particular situation is an important factor affecting collective decisions.
  - [ ] Enabling collective decisions which inform self-governed solutions (policies) at the group level can emerge which enhance sustainable use over time;
  - [ ] Abstracting what crucial attributes are required to sustain management of the common pool resources (Australian Research Council taxpayer pooled funds);
  - [ ] If taxpayers want research groups to be more efficient by solving problems through group strategies, then research funding agencies should utilise policies which encourage collective action outcomes? 

## What do we want to understand from playing this experimental-game?
To evaluate the framework of the game, we will collect survey data from the participants (after the completion of the experimental-game) about their perceptions and values for making decisions.
  - [x] How to adjust the framework (policies/rules), which enable an individual to decide to either cooperate or defect from a local commons problem:
  - [x] How individuals gather information about the incentives of a situation;
  - [x] How the context of the group dilema is approached;
  - [x] How individuals percieve information about themselves.

Nota Bena: games similar to the above were conducted by Cooper 1999, Karlan 2003; however Ostrom et al were the first to propose an experimental common pool resource game where where the subjects context is used to explain variation in experimental behavior.

# Run-sheet instruction for field experiment
Context of game play for the moderator of the experiment:
  - [ ] The study of collective action requires an understanding of the "individual incentives" and of the "institutional constraints" that guide people in making choices about 'cooperating' or 'defecting' on the group facing the dilemma. 
  - [ ] This is an economic experiment (game theory) asking how researchers collectively access taxpayer funds, aka common pool resources (CPRs).
  - [ ] The game explores the extraction from local CPRs (Australian taxpayer researcher funds), where either: individual extraction increases "well-being", but aggregate extraction decreases it.
  - [ ] How can groups solve/optimise the problem through self-governing mechanisms (aka policy aka jointly agreed graduated sanctions)
  - [ ] Cooperation can happen and be chosen by individuals as a rational strategy (vs deciding not to jointly address the problem aka 'tragedy of the commons' aka rational egoist theory aka self-interest economic utility).
  - [ ] Game assumptions: what are the layers of information that individual researchers might use to decide their layers of cooperation?
      - [ ] Material incentives that the specific production function imposes?
      - [ ] Dynamics of the game, e.g. iterative interactions bring reciprocity motives into the decision making process
      - [ ] Composition of the group and the individual characteristics of the players influences decisions to cooperate or defect in the experiment: (a) prior experience of participants prior experience of the participants; (b) their perception of external regulation; or (c) the composition of the group in terms of their wealth and social position.
  - [ ] The games results should suggest that understanding the multiple levels of the game has the potential for helping solve collective-action dilema like research collaboration?
       - [ ] game level incentives: (a) acquire research grant funding from taxpayer funded government funding pools, like the ARC, NHMRC, ARDC, etc.; (b) acquire research grant funding from industry partners.
       - [ ] game level contexts (group and individual characteristics): (a) individual relationship between researchers; (b) overlap between their fields of study.

## Game rules and play
  - [ ] Groups of 8 people interacting for 2-4 hours, followed-up by survey with individual researchers.
  - [ ] To achieve statistical significance (p-value)? => 15x groups = 120 people
  - [ ] 40 people from each community (assymetric information about people in each group?)
  - [ ] Rounds of play time equivalence => annual/semester? For example: each player chooses the number of semesters in a year?
  - [ ] The payoff function table is constructed as a typical common-pool resource dilemma, where individual extractions increased personal gains, but aggregate extractions decreased everyone's gains.
  - [ ] In each round, each player learns from the experimenter the total extraction level by all eight players.
      - [ ] For each round players decide to allocate N semesters/years to acquiring ARC funds
      - [ ] The key payoff benchmark is the social pareto optimum of 1 out of 8 months per player.
      - [ ] The Nash equilibrium is 6 out of 8 months, e.g. 24% of the optimum.
  - [ ] All participants are asked to be surveyed/interviewed at the end of each session, this information is used to link their decisions to the game play layers.
  - [ ] Each player was paid for their time, and a show-up prize provided as incentive.

### Play instructions
Instructions are read out-loud with visual aids (slides/posters), players are encouraged to ask questions at any time.
  - [ ] Thank you for attending this game workshop, special thanks to the [contact person in the group] for helping organise.
  - [ ] We will spend 2 hours in total playing this game, including explaining the game, playing several rounds of the game and doing a survey/interview at the end of the game.  Let's get started!
  - [ ] The following exercise is a different and entertaining way of participating actively in the economic decisions research groups face when accessing research funding, like ARC (Australian Research Council) grants.
  - [ ] Besides participating in the workshop, and being able to earn [prizes/recognition], you will participate in a community workshop in [N days] to discuss the workshop and other matters about accessing taxpayer funded grants.
  - [ ]  During the day of the workshop we will give you rewards based on the earnings you make during the game. 
  - [ ]  In addition to the "show-up prize" for signing up and participating, you will receive [reward/recognition] for succssfully participating in the game once you have completed your individual survey/interview.
  - [ ]  The funds to cover the [prizez/recognition] you will recieve have been provided by [organisation/council]

#### Game introduction
  - [ ]  This game attempts to recreate a situation where a group of researcher must make decisions about how to use the resources of a government research funding agency like the ARC, or any other taxpayer funded research grant. 
  - [ ]  In the case of this community [name of the research group], an example would be applying for research grant funding from the ARC and/or NHMRC.
  - [ ]  You have been selected to participate in a research group of 8 people among the researchers that signed up for playing. 
  - [ ]  The game in which you will participate now is different from the ones others researchers have already played from your community. Thus, the comments that you may have heard from other researchers do not necessarily apply to this game. 
  - [ ]  You will play this game for several rounds equivalent, for instance, to [years or academic semesters]. 
  - [ ]  At the end of the game you will be able to earn some [prizes/recognition] in kind. The [prizes/recognition] will depend on the quantity of points that you accumulate after several rounds.

#### Game payoffs table
  - [ ]  To be able to play you will receive a PAYOFFS TABLE equal to the one shown in the poster-slide. 
  - [ ]  [...MONITOR: show PAYOFFS TABLE in poster and distribute PAYOFFS TABLE to participants...] 
  - [ ]  This table contains all the information that you need to make your decision in each round of the game. The numbers that are inside the table correspond to [points or Australian dollars ASD] that you would earn in each round. 
  - [ ]  The only thing that each of you has to decide in each round is the number of [months/semesters/years] that you want to allocate APPLYING FOR RESEARCH GRANTS [in the columns from 0 to 8].

#### Game cards
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92492030/148876297-8080e18c-11ec-46b3-93eb-b71bee82d188.png)
  - [ ]  To play in each round you must write your decision number between 0 and 8 in a [yellow] GAME CARD like the one I am about to show you. 
  - [ ]  [...MONITOR: show yellow GAME CARDS and show in the poster...] 
  - [ ]  It is very important that we keep in mind that the decisions are absolutely individual, that is, that the numbers we write in the game card are private and that we do not have to show them to the rest of members of the group if we do not want to. 
  - [ ]  The monitor will collect the 8 cards from all participants, and will add the total [semesters/months] that the group decides to use applying for research grants. When the monitor announces the group total, each of you will be able to calculate the points that you earned in the round. Let us explain this with an example:
      - [ ]  In this game we assume that each player has available a maximum of [8 MONTHS] to work each year applying for research grants from the likes of the ARC or other taxpayer funding pools. In reality this number could be larger or smaller but for purposes of our game we will assume [8 as maximum]. 
      - [ ]  In the PAYOFFS TABLE this corresponds to the columns from [0 to 8]. Each of you must decide from 0 to 8 in each round. 
      - [ ]  But, to be able to know how many [point/dollars] you earned, you need to know the decisions that the rest in the group made.
      - [ ]  That is why the monitor will announce in each round the total for the group. 
      - [ ]  For instance, if you decide to use 2 months applying for ARC grant funding and the rest of the group together, add to 20 months of grant writing effort, you would gain [____ points]. 
  - [ ]  Let us look at two other examples in the poster:
      - [ ] [...MONITOR: show poster with THREE additional examples...] 
      - [ ] Now let's look at how the game works in each round.

#### Game decision forms
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92492030/148876249-4a1b0758-24a2-4b26-b42a-53962df72b76.png)
  - [ ] To play each participant will receive one [green DECISIONS FORM] like the one shown in the poster in the wall. We will explain how to use this sheet. 
  - [ ] [...MONITOR: show the DECISIONS FORM in the poster-slide and distributes the DECISIONS FORMS...]
  - [ ] With some further examples, let us see how to use this DECISIONS FORM. 
      - [ ] Suppose that you decided to play 5 in this round. 
      - [ ] In the [yellow GAME CARD] you should write 5. Also you must write this number in the first column A of the decisions form. 
      - [ ] The monitor will collect the [8 yellow cards] and will add the total of the group. 
      - [ ] Suppose that the total added 26 months. Thus, we write 26 in the column B of the decisions form. 
      - [ ] [...MONITOR: In the poster, write the same example numbers in the respective cells...]
      - [ ] To calculate the [third column (C)], we subtract from the group total, MY MONTHS APPLYING FOR GRANTS and then we obtain THEIR MONTHS APPLYING FOR GRANTS which we write in column C. In our example, 26 - 5 = 21. 
      - [ ] If we look at the PAYOFFS TABLE, when MY MONTHS are 5 and THEIR MONTHS are 21, I earn N points. I write then this number in the column D of the DECISIONS FORM.
      - [ ] It is very important to clarify that nobody, except for the monitor, will be able to know the number that each of you decide in each round. 
      - [ ] The only thing announced in public is the group total, without knowing how each participant in your group played. 
  - [ ] Let us repeat the steps with a new example. 
      - [ ] [...MONITOR: Repeat with the other two examples, writing the numbers in the joint group poster-slides...]
  - [ ] It is important repeating that your game decisions and earnings information is private. Nobody in your group or outside of it will be able to know how many point/$ you earned or your decisions during rounds. 
  - [ ] We hope these examples help you understand how the game works, and how to make your decisions to allocate your MONTHS in each round of the game. If at this moment you have any question about how to earn points in the game, please raise your hand and let us know
  - [ ] [...MONITOR: pause to resolve questions...]
  - [ ] It is very important that while we explain the rules of the game you do not engage in conversations with other people in your group.
  - [ ] If there are no further questions about the game, then we will assign the numbers for the players and the rest of forms needed to play.

### Prepare to play game
  - [ ] Now write down your player number in the [green DECISIONS FORM]. Write also [your location/timezone] and the [current date and time, including year, month, date and day of the week including your current time]. 
  - [ ] In the following poster-slides we summarize for you the steps to follow to play in each round. 
  - [ ] Please raise your hand if you have a question. 
  - [ ] [MONITOR: Read the steps to them from the poster]
  - [ ] Before we start, and once all players have understood the game completely, the monitor will announce one additional rule for this group. 
  - [ ] To start the first round of the game we will organize the [seats/conference] where each of you will not be able to see the faces of each other, e.g. you will only be able to see the shared poster-slides. 
  - [ ] For each round, the monitor will your [yellow GAME CARDS]. 
  - [ ] Finally, to get ready to play the game, please let us know if you have difficulties reading or writing numbers and one of the monitors will assist you in private with your data entry. 
  - [ ] Also, please keep in mind that from now on no conversation or communications should be made by you during the game unless the monitor instructs you accordingly.
  - [ ] We will have first a few rounds of practice that will NOT count for the real earnings, just for your practicing of the game.

# Summary of instructions (trial game play)
  - [ ] Objective of the game: To earn as much points as possible at the end of the rounds, which will be converted into [prizes/recognition] for your research group. 
  - [ ] How is it played: In each round, you must decide how many months in a year between 0 and 8, you want to devote to apply for research grants from the ARC. 
  - [ ] The points you earn in each round depend on your decision and the decisions by the rest of the group, according to the [PAYOFFS TABLE (blue table)]. 
  - [ ] What do you need: To play you need a blue PAYOFFS TABLE, a green DECISIONS FORM, and several yellow GAME CARDS. 
  - [ ] Also you need a player number. 
  - [ ] Steps to play in each round: Using the blue PAYOFFS TABLE, decide how many MONTHS APPLYING FOR RESEARCH GRANTS you will play. 
  - [ ] In the DECISIONS FORM write your decision (MY MONTHS APPLYING FOR GRANTS) in Column A for the round being played at that moment. In a yellow GAME CARD write the round number, and your decision APPLYING FOR GRANTS. Make sure it corresponds to the DECISIONS FORM. Hand the yellow game card to the monitor and wait for the monitor to calculate the total from all the cards in the group. 
  - [ ] The Monitor will announce the TOTAL GROUP MONTHS. 
      - [ ] In the green DECISIONS FORM write this total in Column B (TOTAL GROUP MONTHS APPLYING FOR RESEARCH GRANTS). 
      - [ ] In the green DECISIONS FORM calculate Column C (THEIR MONTHS APPLYING FOR GRANTS) equals to Column B minus Column A. 
      - [ ] In the green DECISIONS FORM write in Column D the total points you earned for this round. 
      - [ ] To know how many points you made, use the PAYOFFS TABLE and columns A and C (MY MONTHS and THEIR MONTHS). 
      - [ ] We will also calculate this quantity with the yellow cards to verify.
  - [ ] Let us play another round (Go back to step 1).

## Rules
  - [ ] RULE A: THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE GROUP 
      - [ ] Besides the rules described in the instructions that we just explained, there is an additional rule for the participants in this group: You will not be able to communicate with any member of your group before, during or after you make your individual decision in each round. 
      - [ ] Please do not make any comment to another participant or to the group in general. After the last round we will add the points you earned in the game.
  - [ ] Rule B: COMMUNICATION WITH MEMBERS OF THE GROUP 
      - [ ] Besides the rules described in the instructions that we just explained, there is an additional rule for the participants in this group: 
      - [ ] Please make a circle or sit around a table with the rest of your group. 
      - [ ] Before making your decision in each round, you will be able to have an open discussion of maximum 5 minutes with the members of your group. 
      - [ ] You will be able to discuss the game and its rules in any fashion, except you cannot use any promise or threat or transfer points. Simply an open discussion. 
      - [ ] The rest of the rules hold. 
      - [ ] We will let you know when the 5 minutes have ended. Then you will suspend the conversation and should make your individual decision for the next round. 
      - [ ] These decisions will still be private and individual as in the past rounds and cannot be known to the rest of the group or other people.
  - [ ] Rule C: EXTERNAL REGULATION 
      - [ ] Besides the rules described in the instructions that we just explained, there is an additional rule for the participants in this group: 
      - [ ] This new rule is for making everyone obtain the maximum points possible for the group. 
      - [ ] Let us try to guarantee that each player in your group plays [1 MONTH APPLYING FOR GRANTS]. 
      - [ ] If a player were to play more than one month we will impose a penalty for each additional month s/he plays in the forest. 
      - [ ] However, it would be very difficult to inspect all members of a community. Thus, we will select one of you randomly in your group. Only those selected will have to show (to the monitor only) how many [MONTHS APPLYING FOR GRANTS] they decided to play. 
      - [ ] For instance, suppose that the penalty is 500 points for each additional month. If a player is selected randomly, and s/he had played 3 MONTHS IN THE FOREST, the monitor will subtract 1,000 points from her total points earned in that round. 
      - [ ] The monitor will now announce how many points the penalty will be for each month above 1, and how the player to be inspected will be chosen.
