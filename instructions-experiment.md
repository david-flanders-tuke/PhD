# Field experiment: collective action by researchers arising from use of common pool resource dilemmas

This experiment will investigate the collective-action dilemma which groups of researchers face when accessing common-pool resources (such as taxpayer funded research grants, like the Australian Research Council).  The experiment hypothesizes three outcomes for the participants: (i) defection from the group (aka 'tragedy of the commons'), (ii) self-promotion in the group (Nash equilibrium), and/or (iii) cooperation in the group (Pareto social optimisation).  The decision making process for each researcher in the group experiment, will be individually evaluated against an economic theory of public good or common-pool resources. 

The following research experiment is a replication of the field experiement which Juan-Camilo Cardenas and Elinor Ostrom conducted with three rural villages in Columbia (1998) to explore their use of local forestry resources for individual benefit between 1994-2004.  Below is a summary of the research produced on those experiments and how those game-theory experiments have been adapted for by research groups accessing common pool taxpayer funds, like ARC funding.

Theoretically, the experimental-game asks questions about the percieved "contemporary" economic theory ("theory of goods") which explains collective human behaviour based on the "normal economic" setting of: 
  - [ ] exchange of private goods in an open competitive market
  - [ ] goods involved are easily excludable and rivalrous
  - [ ] individuals are interacting in a competitive market

The experimental-game questions the above "normal economic" theoretical predictions by proposing an alternative empirical condition:
  - [x] what if the goods in the game are not easy to exclude[1], e.g. the goods are common property resources which "anyone" can access?
  - [x] what if the participants accessing the goods are encouraged to participate in an iterative conversation on how to access the goods [2] (vs an open competive market with 'single-shot' sales)?
  - [x] what if a cultural norm for "cheap talk" is encouraged (via policy) whereby non-binding "contractual" conversation is allowed[3]?

Why should experimental field research be conducted with researchers to ascertain how to optimise their use of CPR taxpayer funds?
 - [ ] Researchers accessing taxpayer funds from common pool taxpayer resources face a major challenge to be placed within a theoretical construct of human behaviour where classical economical models could be applied to the exchange of goods in full-information market settings. 
 - [ ] Researchers have a wider range of motivations when they individually use CPR systems that are made up of non-private goods (Hirschmann 1985), like research council funding.
 - [ ] A broader framework is required to propose a theoretical synthesis for researcher's economic behaviours:
     - [ ] the types of norms adopted by individuals, 
     - [ ] the importance of group characteristics, 
     - [ ] the possibilities for using reputation and reciprocity, and 
     - [ ] the specific rules used in particular settings.

Nota bena:
  - [1]= previous research suggests that these games will end in a "tragedy of the comons" where the resource is accessed until depleted, e.g. in repeated games, the average level of contribution starts at around 50 percent but, without opportunities for communication, slowly decays toward the predicted zero level (Ledyard 1995).
  - [2]= neoclassical theory for individuals maximizing material payoffs predicts that individuals tend to contribute, on average, between 40 to 60 percent of their (experimentally) assigned assets in a one-shot game (Davis and Holt 1993; Isaac and Walker 1988).
  - [3]= Subjects who are able to sustain cooperation in public good experiments for long periods of time (near optimal Pareto withdrawal levels) are able to outperform competitive markets when they are able to communicate, come to their own agreements, and use agreed-upon punishments if someone deviates from from the agreement (Sally 1995; Isaac and Walker 1988) (Ostrom et al, 1994).

## Why should researcher groups want to play this game?
  - [ ] If researchers are expected to work collaboratively, then understanding the expectations for the outputs which are achieved on behalf of the taxpayer should be made explicit within the research group.
  - [ ] Understanding how individual researchers learn about and interpret the information potentially available to them in a particular situation is an important factor affecting collective decisions.
  - [ ] Enabling collective decisions which inform self-governed solutions (policies) at the group level can emerge which enhance sustainable use over time;
  - [ ] Abstracting what crucial attributes are required to sustain management of the common pool resources (Australian Research Council taxpayer pooled funds);
  - [ ] If taxpayers want research groups to be more efficient by solving problems through group strategies, then research funding agencies should utilise policies which encourage collective action outcomes? 

## What do we want to understand from playing this experimental-game?
To evaluate the framework of the game, we will collect survey data from the participants (after the completion of the experimental-game) about their perceptions and values for making decisions.
  - [x] How to adjust the framework (policies/rules), which enable an individual to decide to either cooperate or defect from a local commons problem:
  - [x] How individuals gather information about the incentives of a situation;
  - [x] How the context of the group dilema is approached;
  - [x] How individuals percieve information about themselves.

Nota Bena: games similar to the above were conducted by Cooper 1999, Karlan 2003; however Ostrom et al were the first to propose an experimental common pool resource game where where the subjects context is used to explain variation in experimental behavior.

# Run-sheet instruction for field experiment
Context of game play for the moderator of the experiment:
  - [ ] The study of collective action requires an understanding of the "individual incentives" and of the "institutional constraints" that guide people in making choices about 'cooperating' or 'defecting' on the group facing the dilemma. 
  - [ ] This is an economic experiment (game theory) asking how researchers collectively access taxpayer funds, aka common pool resources (CPRs).
  - [ ] The game explores the extraction from local CPRs (Australian taxpayer researcher funds), where either: individual extraction increases "well-being", but aggregate extraction decreases it.
  - [ ] How can groups solve/optimise the problem through self-governing mechanisms (aka policy aka jointly agreed graduated sanctions)
  - [ ] Cooperation can happen and be chosen by individuals as a rational strategy (vs deciding not to jointly address the problem aka 'tragedy of the commons' aka rational egoist theory aka self-interest economic utility).
  - [ ] Game assumptions: what are the layers of information that individual researchers might use to decide their layers of cooperation?
      - [ ] Material incentives that the specific production function imposes?
      - [ ] Dynamics of the game, e.g. iterative interactions bring reciprocity motives into the decision making process
      - [ ] Composition of the group and the individual characteristics of the players influences decisions to cooperate or defect in the experiment: (a) prior experience of participants prior experience of the participants; (b) their perception of external regulation; or (c) the composition of the group in terms of their wealth and social position.
  - [ ] The games results should suggest that understanding the multiple levels of the game has the potential for helping solve collective-action dilema like research collaboration?
       - [ ] game level incentives: (a) acquire research grant funding from taxpayer funded government funding pools, like the ARC, NHMRC, ARDC, etc.; (b) acquire research grant funding from industry partners.
       - [ ] game level contexts (group and individual characteristics): (a) individual relationship between researchers; (b) overlap between their fields of study.

## Game rules and play
  - [ ] Groups of 8 people interacting for 2-4 hours, followed-up by survey with individual researchers.
  - [ ] To achieve statistical significance (p-value)? => 15x groups = 120 people
  - [ ] 40 people from each community (assymetric information about people in each group?)
  - [ ] Rounds of play time equivalence => annual/semester? For example: each player chooses the number of semesters in a year?
  - [ ] The payoff function table is constructed as a typical common-pool resource dilemma, where individual extractions increased personal gains, but aggregate extractions decreased everyone's gains.
  - [ ] In each round, each player learns from the experimenter the total extraction level by all eight players.
      - [ ] For each round players decide to allocate N semesters/years to acquiring ARC funds
      - [ ] The key payoff benchmark is the social pareto optimum of 1 out of 8 months per player.
      - [ ] The Nash equilibrium is 6 out of 8 months, e.g. 24% of the optimum.
  - [ ] All participants are asked to be surveyed/interviewed at the end of each session, this information is used to link their decisions to the game play layers.
  - [ ] Each player was paid for their time, and a show-up prize provided as incentive.
