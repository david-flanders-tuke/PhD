# Framework for evaluation of group decisions
After the game is played each researcher is interviewed to evaluate the motivation behaind each of their decisions.

## What layers of information do researchers bring into a common pool resource game like ARC funding grants?
 - [ ] Institutions produce numerous "rules of the game" (policies) which transform key elements involved in the decision of an individual.
 - [ ] Information about the componets of the game (or lack thereof)
 - [ ] Information about the other participants in the game (or lack thereof)
 - [ ] Individuals gather information by interacting with:
     - [ ] institutional (layers), e.g. ARC funding, University policy, Research funding 
     - [ ] rules which have consequences on their individual value, e.g. reputation, h-index, promotional status, etc.

## What are the layers of the game which should be evaluated?
Previous theoretical frameworks include:
  - [ ] behavioural model of collective action (Ostrom 1994) (Cardenas 2000)
  - [ ] aguments for a model of endogenous preferences (Bowle 1998)
  - [ ] cognitive model of social exchange (McCabe/Smith 2003)

Further theoretical evaluation is required to determine if the above (and/or other) models are applicable to researchers' playing common pool resources games?
  - [ ] how applicable are the above models for researcher groups in their various day-to-day contexts for making decisions about resource use?
  - [ ] how much do institutions affect individual decisions to cooperate?  Ostrom argues (1998, 2000) the following 3x factors:
       - [ ] Do institutions reinforce social norms that are consistent with the rules?
       - [ ] Do institutions allow particiaptns to gather more or less information about the behaviour of others?
       - [ ] Do institutions entitle people to reward or punish certain behaviours with material and non-material incentives?

Based on the above 'theoretical frameworks' the below 3x layers of information (identity, group, payoff) are proposed for game-play evaluation by Ostrom et al

 1. (z) identity layer = [i]-level-data

  - [ ] Game play strategy = intrinsic values (perception of self)
  - [ ] Other-regarding preferences: 
      - [ ] individualÃ­s utility increases with material payoffs, but decreases with the level of disadvantageous or advantageous inequality in outcomes;
      - [ ] utility maximising rationality: awareness for both personal payoff and the 'others' outcome, e.g. joy from cooperating or defecting depending on one's personal values
  - [ ] process-related preferences: 
      - [ ] reciprocity/fairness in multi-round games with communications and sanctioning
  - [ ] when imperfect information exists about material (payoff, strategies, other players), then past similar game experiences relied upon to fill in gaps.
  - [ ] this game play strategy used when externalities are involved, e.g. if a one-shot game then this layer is ignored.
  - [ ] Layers of information for game participant to collect:
      - [ ] wealth, e.g. "do I care if I defect on others?"
      - [ ] occupation, e.g. "do I enjoy cooperating"
      - [ ] experience, e.g. "do I enjoy competing?"
      - [ ] "other" regarding preferences, e.g. "does my experience in similar games provide hints on how to play the game?"
      - [ ] values about "state" vs "self" governance,
      - [ ] gender
      - [ ] age
      - [ ] education
      - [ ] skills

 2. (y) group context layer = [g]-level-data

  - [ ] Game play strategy = evolutionary symbiotic/mutalistic modelling (asymetric info on other players)
      - [ ] knowing other players value outside of game changes strategy
      - [ ] awareness that same players will be encountered again
      - [ ] assessment for fraction of trustworthy vs opportunistic players = likilihood % for group composition to achieve mutual gains
      - [ ] level and equality of power among players increased the frequency of mutual agreements (Lawler+Yoon 1996)
      - [ ] Prisoner dilema games outcomes changed based on awareness of other players being from subgroups (from same location, same organisation, same club, etc)
      - [ ] race/ethnicity and heterogeneity/inequality affects collective action (Ostrom 1965) (Bergstrom 1986)
      - [ ] educational affiliation changes game theorectical predictions, e.g. nurses cooperated more than economists (Cadsby+Maynes 1998)
      - [ ] cutural affiliation affect game theoretical predictions, e.g. East Germans cooperated less than West Germans (Ockenfels+Weinmann 1999)
      - [ ] players with greater wealth invested in the game may be willing to provide the public good, inducing cooperation.
  - [ ] Layers of information for game participant to collect:
      - [ ] shared norms, e.g. "who are the others in my group"
      - [ ] heterogeneity and inequality, e.g. "can 'they' be trusted"
      - [ ] group identity, e.g. "do they usually cooperate in this and similar games?"
      - [ ] cooperative or competitive setting, e.g. "do they follow social norms?"

 3. (x) material payoff game layer = [t, t+1]-level-data

  - [ ] Game play strategy = one-shot pay-off:
  - [ ] set of empircal (formal) rules which decide material cost benefits/penalties/restrictions, e.g. prisoner's dilema.
  - [ ] this strategy is changed once enforcement/transaction costs are enforced, thereby brining the other layers of the game into play.
  - [ ] NB this strategy has a non-zero probability of being faced in future rounds of the game (Axelrod 1984), e.g. the liklihood of meeting the same players in future rounds of the game changes the strategy.
      - [ ] players can learn and have memory
      - [ ] players can build reputation
      - [ ] players can jointly build historic reputation(s)
      - [ ] memory for cooperation between players results in a probability for continuing to reciprocate (as well as joint retaltion against non-cooperative players).
      - [ ] players who start cooperating, but observe others free-riding, decrease their cooperation, aka "crowding-out of cooperative behaviour" (Cardenas 2000)
      - [ ] cooperation can be crowded-out by explicit incentives or sanctions (Frey Jegen 2004)
      - [ ] number of rounds explicitly affects this game play strategy sic 'linear public good game' (Isacc et al 1994) and "rational actor" (Ostrom 1998), e.g. 10 rounds = contribution falls from 50% to 10% by 10th round; 40 rounds = 10th round (40% contribution) --> 40th round (10% contribution); and, 60 rounds = 10th round (50% contribution) --> 40th round (30% contriution) --> 60th round (10% contribution).
  - [ ] Layers of information for game participant to collect:
      - [ ] net payoff from each feasible strategy, e.g. "what material payoffs can I obtain from my actions and those of others in the game?"
      - [ ] feasible strategies, e.g. "what can I learn from previous rounds of this game?"
      - [ ] enforced laws and rules (expected costs), e.g. "what can happen in future rounds of this game because of what happens in previous rounds?"
      - [ ] reputation and learning [t-1]
      - [ ] reciprocity [t+1]
  - [ ] Combinatorial affects of game play layers and strategies aka the conditions of one layer may reinforce or diminish the effect of another layer:
      - [ ] willingness to cooperate (sympathy-->reciprocity) = "fellow-feeling person [i] has for person [j]" e.g. a person(s) will reduce their fellow-feeling for another, when they feel they are being taken advantage of (Sally 2001)
      - [ ] Additional layers of information may be obtained (depending on ease/cost)
      - [ ] There are no panacea for how groups will interact in different contexts/cultures, etc.
      - [ ] When information layers are not asymetric between players, then they will search for information from other layers to internalize their vision of the game.

 4. #!= The above layers are calculated to predict the decision by participants to cooperate in the game, e.g. these decisions transform the game from an (external) materials pay-off game into an (internal) utility game => X [t-1, t+1][i][g]

  - [ ] It's the structure of the game-play which transforms the context of the players (from "normal economic" theory to "collective action" theory): (a) repetition of interaction as game play, (b) non-anonymous game play, (c) awareness of externalities amongst players beyond game understanding that net individual and group gains may be achieved from gathering additional information, and (d) even if costly, jointly constructing rules can be prove valuable.
  - [ ] The result of adopting these new game-play strutures will be a new awareness for achieving new cooperative Nash-Pareto strategies (vs Nash-Tragedy strategies), e.g. social dilema games (one-shot pay-off) could be transformed into assurance games.
  - [ ] To predict the liklihood of a participant either cooperating or defecting in a collective-action problem, the following outcomes *could* be achieved: Nash strategy to defect, <OR?> Pareto-optimal strategy is achieved at universal cooperation?
  - [ ] Factors  (information) which influence the decision to cooperate to achieve a pareto-superior outcome for all:
      - [ ] lack or learning and understanding of the game
      - [ ] inhereted altruitic preferences by humans
      - [ ] individual engagement in reciprocity via iterative games
